Blackbox is a web automation framework written in Java using Selenium WebDriver and JUnit.

## Prerequisites ##

### Running Tests in Mozilla Firefox ###

The very latest versions of Firefox are usually not yet supported by WebDriver. Please see the [list of supported platforms](http://www.seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.jsp) to determine which version of Firefox you will need to have installed.

### Running Tests in Google Chrome ###

You will need to download the [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) in order for the WebDriver to be able to attach to a Chrome instance.
